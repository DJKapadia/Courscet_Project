1.)In Automatically data file , we automatic fetch the data into our json file and convert it into dataframe. After we transform data into sql file from dataframe and then we perform our sql query to fetch appropriate result.

2.)In manually data file, we manually enter the data in our table and store it in database. And then we perform our sql query to fetch appropriate result.
